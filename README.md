(Won't work on) Image-Finder is a simple web application that allows you to search for images using the Pixabay API. It is built using React, Axios, PropTypes, Randomcolor, Shortid, Styled Components, and Web Vitals. 

Please check [ImaGo](https://github.com/KitsuneAkvma/ImaGo), That's older and more primitive project but I like it  more and plan to rework it sometime to react and maybe add some backend or at least local storage.

**Demo:** [Image-Finder Demo](https://kitsuneakvma.github.io/Image-Finder/)
